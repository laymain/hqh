## 🎮 *Guild of Highly Questionable Heroes: Audit of Destiny*

### Concept Snapshot

A 2D action-RPG where every dungeon run is an *official audit* of a hopeless Heroic Guild.  
Players fight, loot, and “file reports” to justify the guild’s funding—combining **fast ARPG combat** with a **meta-progression loop** of attunement and perks, all wrapped in bureaucratic comedy.

### 🔁 Core Loop

1. **Briefing at the Guild Hall**  
   Choose hero → receive Mission Order → select difficulty tier.  
2. **Audit Expedition (Dungeon)**  
   Clear rooms, collect absurd gear, attune equipment by using it.  
3. **Boss Encounter & Report Filing**  
   Defeat the “Incident of the Day.” Earn attunement XP and Guild points.  
4. **Guild Review (Hub Phase)**  
   Unlock new perks, ranks, and funny job titles.  
5. **Repeat at Higher Audit Levels**  
   Normal → Heroic → Mythic → Insanity, each adding enemy quirks and narrative parody.

### ⚙️ Systems Overview

* **Attunement** – Every equipped item accumulates “heroic citations.”  
  When certified, it grants a permanent stat bonus on the account.  
* **Perks / Certificates** – Humorous micro-licenses:  
  *“Certified Fire Inspector (-10 % Fire DMG taken)”*   
  Activated in the Guild lobby; unlocked through gameplay milestones.  
* **Difficulty Scaling** – Four audit ranks controlling enemy modifiers and loot tiers.  
* **Meta Progression** – Guild reputation + attuned items collectively raise the “Audit Score,” unlocking new heroes and missions.  
* **Hub Evolution** – More NPCs, new bureaucracy jokes, trivial side tasks between runs.

### 🎭 Tone & Presentation

* **Humor:** self-aware bureaucratic fantasy à la Pratchett or Douglas Adams.  
* **Art:** pixel-art 16×16, warm palette, cartoon exaggeration.  
* **Sound:** playful medieval office ambiance (quills, gongs, lute muzak).  
* **UI flavor:** parchment pop-ups, rubber stamp animations for progression.

### 🎯 First Playable / MVP Goals

* 1 playable hero (Warrior).  
* 1 audit region (3–4 rooms + 1 boss).  
* Functional hub with mission board & attunement menu.  
* Basic perk & difficulty system toggles.  

Everything beyond that grows modularly: new hero classes = new skill prefabs; new dungeons = additional room sets.

### 🗺  Development Philosophy
**“Loose rails.”**  
Keep the loop tight and expandable; let tone, jokes, and item ideas emerge during playtesting.  
Document only interfaces and data you must share with future content—leave story beats, item names, and NPC dialogue free to improvise later.
